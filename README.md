# GMAIL CLONE APP

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/codetophel/gmail-clone), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. Firebase firestore was used as database,firebase google authentication was used for login feature. Material UI was used for icons,buttons and avatar. Custom css was mostly used for the styling.

- This idea is to recreate gmail inbox web layout with minimal functionalities like sending mails, displaying list of mails in inbox and navigating to each mails.

- The COMPOSE button in the sidebar is designed to pop up a modal on the right bottom of the screen when clicked.
  The modal displays a form where you can send mail to recipients. Submission of the form automatically closes the modal and displays the sent mail in the mails on the homepage.

- Clicking on any mail takes you to the mail page directly.
